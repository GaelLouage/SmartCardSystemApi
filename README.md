SmartCardSystemApi

SmartCardSystemApi is a .NET-based library for managing smart card access levels and authentication mechanisms. It provides an abstraction for different access levels and a factory pattern to instantiate appropriate card access handlers.

Features

Smart Card Access Levels: Supports different user levels, including basic users, authenticated users, administrators, and issuers.

Factory Pattern: Uses a factory design pattern to instantiate the correct access level class.

Encapsulation of Access Control: Implements an interface for smart card operations.

Installation

Clone the repository and integrate it into your .NET project:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SmartCardSystemApi.git

Usage

1. Define Smart Card Access Levels

The SmartCardAccessLevel enum defines various access levels:

public enum SmartCardAccessLevel
{
    USER,              // Basic read access
    AUTHENTICATED_USER, // Requires PIN authentication
    ADMINISTRATOR,      // Requires cryptographic authentication
    ISSUER         // Full control by the card issuer
}

2. Smart Card Entity Model

Represents a smart card and its assigned user:

public class SmartCardEntity
{
    public string EmployeeName { get; set; }
    public int EmployeeId { get; set; }
    public string ChipId { get; set; }
    public SmartCardAccessLevel AccessLevel { get; set; }
}

3. Implementing the Interface

The ICardAccess interface defines operations for handling smart card access:

public interface ICardAccess
{
    string Operation();
}

4. Factory Pattern for Access Control

The SmartCardFactory class provides an efficient way to instantiate appropriate access handlers:

public class SmartCardFactory
{
    public static ICardAccess GetSmartCard(SmartCardAccessLevel lvl)
    {
        return lvl switch
        {
            SmartCardAccessLevel.AUTHENTICATED_USER => new AutheticatedUserAccess(),
            SmartCardAccessLevel.ADMINISTRATOR => new AdministratorAccess(),
            SmartCardAccessLevel.ISSUER => new IsSuerAccess(),
            _ => new BasicUserAccess()
        };
    }
}
